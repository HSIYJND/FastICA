FastICA
=======

The FastICA package is a free (GPL) MATLAB program that implements the fast fixed-point algorithm for independent component analysis and projection pursuit. It features an easy-to-use graphical user interface, and a computationally powerful algorithm.

Use:

    addpath('~/path-to-FastICA-folder')

at the start of your m-file (or to startup.m) to make these functions callable.
